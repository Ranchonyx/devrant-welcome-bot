Welcome to devRant %RANT_USER%,

Regards,
@WelcomeBot

this is our decree.

1. This is not StackOverflow, ask your questions somewhere else

2. Use the correct tags for your post.

3. No hashtags (#) in your tags.

4. Tags can contain spaces and are separated by comma.

4. Keep content in English.

5. This is obvious but some people don't get it: it's developer rant, there's only developers here, not fucking HR or managers.

6. No fucking whining for ++, you will just get --'d.

5. Don't post garbage or beg for help with assignments and crap, Google it.
